## Questions to Ask  

1. Is the GitHub late policy still applicable? I think on the Canvas page it noted the online class has a different late policy.  
2. How to create unit tests for my start up application?  
3. Why does the professor suggest using the VS Code live server extension instead of just using web framework development servers like express+nodemon or python flask?
