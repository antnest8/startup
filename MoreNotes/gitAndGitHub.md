# Git and GitHub notes

### Git:
1. Git checkout changes the working directory (it changes the actual files to the repo)

### GitHub:
1. I should first git fetch to add GitHub changes to staged, then git status to check if there were changes
2. Do my normal local git stuff
3. ALWAYS finish a working day by git push to ensure the cloud is up-to-date

Forking a repo simply creates a copy of that repo in GitHub that is linked to the original (for easy re-merging). This is useful for working on open source projects or making large changes to a project (for example implementing an html website with web-app like the Simon Project)
