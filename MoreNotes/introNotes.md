# Intro Notes  
In this class I should seek to become capable, creative, collaborative and curious. This means I should learn how to learn (tools change all the time) (this should be using documentation). I should add my touch to my projects. I should use the discord to communicate often. I should be curious about everything.   

### Why I am Here?
1. What do I want? - To learn how to develop applications on the web to be able to achieve employment and extend my ability to change the world for the better. 
2. I am willing to work ahead of the curve and communicate frequently with TA's and other students. 
3. I want to achieve immersive mastery. 125% of deliverables and engage beyond instruction

### Late Policy
Is the GitHub late policy still applicable? I think on the Canvas page it noted the online class has a different late policy.
