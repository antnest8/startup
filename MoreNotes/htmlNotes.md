# Code Pen
1. It is like an online web development demo repository like GitHub. Meant for quick demos and sharing with others.
2. You can fork other peoples pens and work on them (I am assuming everything on the platform is under an open-source license.)   

## HTML
1. HTML is almost completely focused on the structure and text content of a website, but not on syle or interactive elements.
2. For this reason it is like the skeleton of a website and the js and CSS link to HTML elements.
