1. Leasing domain names cost money...
2. Make sure to type `http://` instead of `https://` to connect to server until a secure connection is available
3. so apparently caddy is a web server (kind of like Apache). I am trying to understand all of this and how it relates to my current knowledge but we are getting there.
